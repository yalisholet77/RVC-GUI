> Realtime Voice Conversion Software using RVC : [w-okada/voice-changer](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer)

> The dataset for the pre-training model uses nearly 50 hours of high quality VCTK open source dataset.

> High quality licensed song datasets will be added to training-set one after another for your use, without worrying about copyright infringement.
## Summary
This repository has the following features:
+ Reduce tone leakage by replacing source feature to training-set feature using top1 retrieval;
+ Easy and fast training, even on relatively poor graphics cards;
+ Training with a small amount of data also obtains relatively good results (>=10min low noise speech recommended);
+ Supporting model fusion to change timbres (using ckpt processing tab->ckpt merge);
+ Easy-to-use Webui interface;
+ Use the UVR5 model to quickly separate vocals and instruments.
## Preparing the environment


The following commands need to be executed in the environment of Python version 3.8 or higher:
```bash
# Install PyTorch-related core dependencies, skip if installed
# Reference: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

#For Windows + Nvidia Ampere Architecture(RTX30xx), you need to specify the cuda version corresponding to pytorch according to the experience of https://github.com/liujing04/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/issues/21
#pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117


```


**Notice**: `faiss 1.7.2` will raise Segmentation Fault: 11 under `MacOS`, please use `pip install faiss-cpu==1.7.0` if you use pip to install it manually.

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -U torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Downlaod [hubert_base.pt](https://huggingface.co/lj1995/VoiceConversionWebUI/resolve/main/hubert_base.pt/) and place it in the root

#If you are using Windows, you may also need this dictionary, skip if FFmpeg is installed
ffmpeg.exe
```
Then use this command to start Webui:
```bash
python rvcgui.py
```
